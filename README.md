This repo has all of my important dotfiles which all toether define my working environment. Follow the following instruction if you want to clone my env to yours.

You might need to copy all files under that to make it work.

##install
just run dotfiles/install to install everything

##.ssh/config
contains hosts that I use a lot

##.bashrc
This file contains the main profile of bash

##.bash_profile
This file only does `source .bashrc`

## .inputrc
I am so use to auto-completing-menu, so I define them here.

##.bash_itrc
contians config about themes in bash_it

##.vimrc
This file defines all the configs that I use for vim.

##.tmux.conf
This file defines all the configs that I use for tmux. Might be system dependent, so change it slightly when you encounter any error.
