#dotfiles
This repo has all of my important dotfiles which all toether define my working environment. Follow the following instruction if you want to clone my env to yours.

This repo assume that you put all files under "~/". You might need to copy all files under that to make it work.

##.vimrc
This file defines all the configs that I use for vim.
###Install plugins
To install the plugin defined in the .vimrc, you will need Vundle, the popular vim plugin manager. Vundle should have been included in this repo(./.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim). If it didn't work, just follow the instruction on Vundle official repo.

##.tmux.conf
This file defines all the configs that I use for tmux. Might be system dependent, so change it slightly when you encounter any error.
